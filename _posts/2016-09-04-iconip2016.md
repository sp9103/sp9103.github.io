Multiple Pregrasping Poses Prediction Using Combining Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Mixture Density Network<br>

<br>Abstract. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network to predict
pregrasp poses of a 3D object. Specifically, a single RGB-D image is used
to determine multiple 3D positions of three fingers which can provide
suitable pregrasps for a known or an unknown object in various poses.
Multiple pregrasping pose prediction is typically complex multi-valued
functions where standard regression models fail. To this end, we proposed
a deep neural network that contains a variant of traditional deep
convolutional neural network, followed by a mixture density network. Additionally,
to overcome the difficulty in learning with insufficient data for
the first part of the proposed network we develop a supervised learning
technique to pretrain the variant of convolutional neural network.
