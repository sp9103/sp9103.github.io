Multiple Pregrasping Poses Prediction Using Combining Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Mixture Density Network<br>

<br>Abstract.
<br>In this paper, we propose a deep neural network to predictpregrasp poses of a 3D object. Specifically, a single RGB-D image is used to determine multiple 3D positions of three fingers which can provide suitable pregrasps for a known or an unknown object in various poses. Multiple pregrasping pose prediction is typically complex multi-valued functions where standard regression models fail. To this end, we proposed a deep neural network that contains a variant of traditional deep convolutional neural network, followed by a mixture density network. Additionally, to overcome the difficulty in learning with insufficient data for the first part of the proposed network we develop a supervised learning technique to pretrain the variant of convolutional neural network. abstract environment.<br><br>
